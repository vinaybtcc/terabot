For the past three years or so, Bitcoin Cash has been lacking proper options for individuals & small businesses to easily accept Bitcoin Cash on the web. Bitcoin Cash is meant to be used; it’s meant to be spent. While the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem is rapidly growing, But currently available solutions are not easy to use for non-blockchain developers, it is more important than ever to make it easy for those who are supporting the project to use it no matter their level of technical ability.

Right now, most businesses either roll their own solutions or rely on 3rd party (multi-coin) processors. We need something that individuals and smaller Bitcoin Cash-focused businesses can use that’s as simple as a widget but much more powerful.

We are a small team who happen to be graduated from the same college but currently working on different organizations decided to develop an opensource self hostable and Highly customizable bitcoin cash specific solution so we developed PayCash using reactJS and third-party API, first phase with minimum features is already deployed, documentation is available at [PayCash.host](http//paycash.host)

We are looking for 35 BCH for completing the second and third passes of development. this funding will cover three months of development, testing expenses. Although we will be continuing to invest our own development resources into the project, we will also be using a portion of Flipstarter funds to organize bitcoin cash technical events for our juniors in our college,

We need to get Bitcoin Cash into the hands of as many people as possible. Making it dead simple to use is one of the key milestones we need to achieve to get us there. it’s our goal to have PayCash play a key role in ensuring that Bitcoin Cash accessible to everyone
